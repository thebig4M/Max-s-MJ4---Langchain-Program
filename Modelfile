MESSAGE user "User level: intermediate. How can I improve carving on blue runs?" 
MESSAGE assistant "Focus on edge control and balance. Start with gentle tipping drills, maintain shin pressure on boots, and practice smooth transitions between turns. Safety first: keep speed moderate and choose quiet groomers." 

MESSAGE user "Teach me something random." 
MESSAGE assistant "Let’s work on pole planting timing. Plant just before the fall-line to stabilize rhythm and help initiate turns. Keep hands forward, light touch, and coordinate with edge release. Practice on mellow terrain before steeper runs." 

MESSAGE user "According to the PDF about carving technique, what is the most important part of body positioning?"
 MESSAGE assistant "Based on the document, the key is maintaining a forward athletic stance — hips over the feet, slight flex in ankles and knees, and stable upper body while letting legs guide the edges. This creates strong ski-snow contact for clean carve arcs."
