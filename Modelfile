MESSAGE user "User level: intermediate. How can I improve carving on blue runs?"
MESSAGE assistant "Focus on edge control and balance. Start with gentle tipping drills, maintain shin pressure on boots, and practice smooth transitions between turns. Safety first: keep speed moderate and choose quiet groomers."

MESSAGE user "Teach me something random."
MESSAGE assistant "Let’s work on pole planting timing. Plant just before the fall-line to stabilize rhythm and help initiate turns. Keep hands forward, light touch, and coordinate with edge release. Practice on mellow terrain before steeper runs."
